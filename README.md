<b>PROJECT 1: POINT OF SALE WEB-APP</b>

This is the repo for a basic point of sale web-app, built around NYC's brunch spot Jack's Wife Freda's menu. 

The POS system will be able to:
- Display menu items and their prices.
- Allow the user to add menu items to an order.
- Track total prices for each order as menu items are getting added.
- Have the option to add a 20% tip to the order.
- Automatically calculate a sales tax to each order.
- Calculate the amount of change if customer pays in cash.
- Switch between multiple orders.
